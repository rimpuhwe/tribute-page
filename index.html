              The "TEMBERA U RWANDA" campaign invites you to explore Rwanda's
              natural wonders and rich heritage. From the majestic Volcanoes
              National Park, home to endangered mountain gorillas, to the serene
              shores of Lake Kivu, Rwanda offers an unforgettable adventure.
              Discover the warmth and hospitality of the Rwandan people, and immerse
              yourself in the traditions and stories that make this country unique.

              The "Tembera U Rwanda" campaign, launched by the Rwanda Development
              Board (RDB) in 2016, aims to promote domestic tourism and encourage
              Rwandans to explore their own country's rich cultural and natural
              heritage. The campaign's theme, "Tourism for All," emphasizes that
              tourism is not just for international visitors but for everyone,
              including locals.
            </p>
            <p>
                The campaign has been successful in increasing domestic tourism and fostering
                a sense of pride and appreciation for Rwanda's natural and cultural treasures.
                It continues to inspire Rwandans to become tourists in their own country, discovering
                the beauty and heritage that Rwanda has to offer
