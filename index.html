            The <strong>"Tembera U Rwanda"</strong> campaign, launched by the 
            <b>
              Rwanda Development
              Board (RDB) in 2016
            </b>, aims to promote domestic tourism and encourage
            Rwandans to explore their own country's rich cultural and natural
            heritage. The campaign's theme, "Tourism for All," emphasizes that
            tourism is not just for international visitors but for everyone,
            including locals.
          </p>
          <p>
            The campaign has been successful in increasing domestic tourism and fostering
            a sense of pride and appreciation for Rwanda's natural and cultural treasures.
            It continues to inspire Rwandans to become tourists in their own country, discovering
            the beauty and heritage that Rwanda has to offer
